#Branching Programs   

# A branching condition has three parts :-

# 1.) Test -----an expression that evaluates True and False. 

# 2.) Block Code ------- A line of statement that defines the sequence of the code.

# 3.) optional block of code --------in case the above block of code is not executed , this set of code will run.


#Indentation---> it is  


# few examples to illustrate :

# For loop :-



a = int(input())


for i in range(a):
    if i % 2 == 0 and i > 1:
        print(i,"is an even number")
    
	
#Python uses indentation unlike other programming languages which uses some sort of brackets like (),{},[].

# In python indenation is a way to write a block of code and it marks the completion of the code.
