# variables is a way by which we associates names with objects.

# A variable is associated with the objects with the help of assignment operator.

#example:-

a=4
b=5

print(a)

print(b)


# output --- 4 , 5

#python variables are case sensitive.

# python has a small number of keywords.

#variables can contain uppercase,lowercase ,digit and special character.

>>> a23 =45
>>> print(a23)
45

#variables names cannot start with digit.

>>> 2as =34
